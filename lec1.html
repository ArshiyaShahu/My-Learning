         <p><h3>How does AI work?</h3> 
            As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their 
            products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the
             technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and
              software for writing and training <strong>machine learning</strong> algorithms. No single programming
               language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular
                with AI developers.
